This game is now available in [itch.io](https://cyberneticcoven.itch.io/the-last-masquerade "https://cyberneticcoven.itch.io/the-last-masquerade") and to all our Patreon backers.

You have been invited to the most exclusive masquerade ball. Dance across a shifting mansion, discovering its secrets as you advance your machinations – but beware. It is not only intrigue that threatens you; flowery monsters accompany flowery words, and if you drop your guard, they will kill you one by one. 

Last Masquerade is a social deduction and intrigue game. Everyone plays guests in a deadly masquerade in a baroque estate, clinging to the safety of a Mask and pursuing secret Agendas. But you are not alone with your sins: a monster hides among the guests. One of you dons the persona of a creature hell-bent on carnage, playing with its prey as it turns you against each other, trying to get you all killed. Will you survive? Will you advance your own sinister goals? Or will you become just another trophy for the monster that prowls Orlesceu Manor?
