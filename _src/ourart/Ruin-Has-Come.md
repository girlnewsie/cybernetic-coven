Do you have what it takes to survive the night? And those around you? How many will die? How many can you afford to lose? What is important to preserve? What will you make important? Ruin Has Come is a game all about making the tough decisions and being the one making such calls – instead of those that may be sacrificed. Set in a town besieged by darkness, the Townsfolk barricade themselves in precious Haven, trying to repel Threats creeping out from encroaching Dungeons. 

In Ruin Has Come, you create a Town and those that live within. Then, you face a stream of Threats, deciding what you are willing to sacrifice to survive them. Finally, you and your choices welcome the dawn. In this brief respite, you can try to conquer Dungeons, rebuild the town, deal with the fallout of your leadership and peer into the abyss. If you are so willing, you may try to survive yet another night…
