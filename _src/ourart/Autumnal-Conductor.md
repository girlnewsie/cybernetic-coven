Proserpina, the Flower Painter, is interrupted by the flowering of the asphodel — a drab, ugly thing that defiles her domain and which drags her down to the Underworld, a realm enemy to all that she is. 

To survive, she will have to seek allies among the dead: a warden of this prison, the grinning poison king, a woman that conned better gods than you and got away with it, the world-conquering dragon, a knight sworn to Her, and the rejected sludge of dying humanity. 

You will make them yours, mold these women into weapons to throw against the minions of your captor and the gates that keep the cosmos together.
