Violet Tangerine is a roleplaying game about the 2e edition of the Italian Job TTRPG, a more streamlined version of the original TTRPG from the 60s; it is lost media, found only reprinted in the last pages of d20 Italian Job released under the OGL in 2003.

It is also a game about heists. The tempo of a heist, the gathering of a Crew, the montage of a plan coming together and when everything falls apart.

In this game you gather a crew of talented and determined individuals and have them try to beat a heist-like scenario. One of you will play the opposition, the House protecting its prizes. Every action counts, so plan carefully and try to squeeze as many advantages for later, but beware, â€Œthe House creates new threats as your options decrease.

Can you make it to the end of the scenario and escape with a big payout?
