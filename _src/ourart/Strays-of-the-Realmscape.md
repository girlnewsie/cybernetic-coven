This first set of this project, the Alpha Set, is currently available only through our Patreon at the Hex-Processor tier or higher.

Do you ever feel like the concept of immortal wizard-gods traversing across worlds would be a great roleplaying game, and is a concept wasted and unappreciated by certain properties? Strays of the Realmscape is born from similar feelings. You are a Realmroamer, a Stray, a being of magic and awe. You get involved and know of the lives of the inhabitants of different Realms, crafting silvery bonds that manifest as cards – Cantrips and Crafts. Your expanding collection of Spellbonds is used to create powerful spells that you are able to use in duels against other Strays and world-threats. 

Grab some dice and pick your first Cantrips as you join in the defense of a newborn Realm against an encroaching empire.
