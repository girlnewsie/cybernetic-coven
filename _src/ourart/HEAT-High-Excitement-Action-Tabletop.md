HEAT - short for High Excitement Action Tabletop - is built on an extremely simple, fast resolution mechanic that is able to then create a completely unexpected outcome, despite the fact it uses no dice or randomness at all. It recreates the tension and thrilling action of a fast paced video game or bone breaking action movie with just a few simple mechanics that unfold into greater and greater complexity as you apply yourself to the game.
