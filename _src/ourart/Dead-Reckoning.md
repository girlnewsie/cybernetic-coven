\*Dead Reckoning\* is a small-scale, skirmish game, focused in customizing your units. Guide your undead faction through a mysterious necropolis, conquering its secrets and learning more about the forces animating you. Whether it’s fighting in cathedrals made from fossilized ribs the size of skyscrapers to plunging through the lightning-strewn caverns of the spinal column, to even heading back above to the cities that have built themselves around a corpse of incomprehensible size and unimaginable power, there’s never a moment where there isn’t some kind of fight breaking out.
