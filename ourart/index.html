                <p><p><em>Dead Reckoning</em> is a small-scale, skirmish game, focused in customizing your units. Guide your undead faction through a mysterious necropolis, conquering its secrets and learning more about the forces animating you. Whether it’s fighting in cathedrals made from fossilized ribs the size of skyscrapers to plunging through the lightning-strewn caverns of the spinal column, to even heading back above to the cities that have built themselves around a corpse of incomprehensible size and unimaginable power, there’s never a moment where there isn’t some kind of fight breaking out.</p>

                <h2>HEAT: High Excitement Action Tabletop

                <p><p>HEAT - short for High Excitement Action Tabletop - is built on an extremely simple, fast resolution mechanic that is able to then create a completely unexpected outcome, despite the fact it uses no dice or randomness at all. It recreates the tension and thrilling action of a fast paced video game or bone breaking action movie with just a few simple mechanics that unfold into greater and greater complexity as you apply yourself to the game.</p>

<p>You have been invited to the most exclusive masquerade ball. Dance across a shifting mansion, discovering its secrets as you advance your machinations – but beware. It is not only intrigue that threatens you; flowery monsters accompany flowery words, and if you drop your guard, they will kill you one by one.</p>
<p>Last Masquerade is a social deduction and intrigue game. Everyone plays guests in a deadly masquerade in a baroque estate, clinging to the safety of a Mask and pursuing secret Agendas. But you are not alone with your sins: a monster hides among the guests. One of you dons the persona of a creature hell-bent on carnage, playing with its prey as it turns you against each other, trying to get you all killed. Will you survive? Will you advance your own sinister goals? Or will you become just another trophy for the monster that prowls Orlesceu Manor?</p>

What will you make important? Ruin Has Come is a game all about making the tough decisions and being the one making such calls – instead of those that may be sacrificed. Set in a town besieged by darkness, the Townsfolk barricade themselves in precious Haven, trying to repel Threats creeping out from encroaching Dungeons.</p>
<p>In Ruin Has Come, you create a Town and those that live within. Then, you face a stream of Threats, deciding what you are willing to sacrifice to survive them. Finally, you and your choices welcome the dawn. In this brief respite, you can try to conquer Dungeons, rebuild the town, deal with the fallout of your leadership and peer into the abyss. If you are so willing, you may try to survive yet another night…</p>

<p>Do you ever feel like the concept of immortal wizard-gods traversing across worlds would be a great roleplaying game, and is a concept wasted and unappreciated by certain properties? Strays of the Realmscape is born from similar feelings. You are a Realmroamer, a Stray, a being of magic and awe. You get involved and know of the lives of the inhabitants of different Realms, crafting silvery bonds that manifest as cards – Cantrips and Crafts. Your expanding collection of Spellbonds is used to create powerful spells that you are able to use in duels against other Strays and world-threats.</p>
<p>Grab some dice and pick your first Cantrips as you join in the defense of a newborn Realm against an encroaching empire.</p>

<p>In this game you gather a crew of talented and determined individuals and have them try to beat a heist-like scenario. One of you will play the opposition, the House protecting its prizes.
