<p>Proserpina, the Flower Painter, is interrupted by the flowering of the asphodel â€” a drab, ugly thing that defiles her domain and which drags her down to the Underworld, a realm enemy to all that she is.</p>
<p>To survive, she will have to seek allies among the dead: a warden of this prison, the grinning poison king, a woman that conned better gods than you and got away with it, the world-conquering dragon, a knight sworn to Her, and the rejected sludge of dying humanity.</p>
<p>You will make them yours, mold these women into weapons to throw against the minions of your captor and the gates that keep the cosmos together.</p>
