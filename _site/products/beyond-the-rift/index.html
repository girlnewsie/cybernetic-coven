<div class="description"><blockquote><p><em>It is a futile game we play. It won't bring our friends home. But perhaps it can give us a little peace, to imagine that their struggles end with a small measure of hope.</em> <em>To our friends beyond the rift, these words are for you.</em></p></blockquote><p></p><p>It has been centuries since the end of the Endless War, when the Grey Mage destroyed the dragons and tore the city of Tower in half. The part that remains in our world stands as a reminder of the cost that was paid for peace. What happened to the other half of Tower is a mystery. The ritual game, <em>Beyond the Rift</em>, is a way for those in the world of Mnemonic to imagine what life might be like for those trapped on the other side of the Rift.</p><p></p><p><em>Beyond the Rift</em> is a tabletop game for 1 to 3 players, which can be played together in the same place or remotely over Discord, Skype, FaceTime, or even text messages. Each player is responsible for one aspect of play, from creating the world beyond the rift, to describing its dangers, to overcoming those dangers and finding resolution for the city of Tower.</p></div>
